## Introduction
[Docker][url-docker-gs] is generally recognized as best practice for achieving automatically reproducible build environments. It provides the means for containerizing self-sufficient build environments that result from the requirements described in a Dockerfile.

This tutorial provides a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and helper scripts that provide the means for building embedded applications with the [IAR Build Tools][url-iar-bx] from a Linux [container][url-docker-container].

## Pre-requisites

### IAR Build Tools
A [__IAR Build Tools__][url-iar-bx] installer package of your choice for Ubuntu(/Debian) in the `.deb` format. IAR customers with a license can download directly from [IAR MyPages](https://iar.my.site.com/mypages). If you do not have a license yet, [contact IAR Sales][url-iar-contact].

The IAR Build Tools installer packages are delivered using the following name standard `bx<arch>[fs]-<V.vv.patch[.build]>.deb` where `[fs]` and `[.build]` in the package names show up to distinguish tools that come pre-certified for [Functional Safety](https://iar.com/fusa).

### Docker Engine
A __x86_64/amd64__ platform supported by the Docker Engine ([supported platforms](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#supported-platforms)) capable of accessing the Internet for downloading the necessary packages. In this guide, network node in which the Docker Engine was installed will be referred to as __DOCKER_HOST__.

### IAR License Server
The [__IAR License Server__](https://links.iar.com/lms2-server) ready to serve, up and running, with __activated__ license(s) for the network nodes with the __IAR Build Tools__ of your choice -and- reachable from the platform in which the __DOCKER_HOST__ is running as described above. If you do not have the licenses you need, [__contact us__][url-iar-contact].


## Installing Docker
To install the Docker Engine on the __DOCKER_HOST__, follow the [official instructions][url-docker-docs-install]. If you want to use Docker Desktop on Windows, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/iarsystems/bx-docker/wiki).

Alternatively, launch a new bash shell and use the following procedure, known to work for most cases:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh ./get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo - $USER
```

## Building a Docker image
Before you can run a container, you need a image containing the required environment. A Dockerfile is a text file that describe how to build a container image.

The [__`build`__](build) script in this repository works as a frontend for building a container image based on this [__Dockerfile__](Dockerfile) and requires an installer package (__bx`<package>`-`<version>`.deb__).

```console
$ build -h
 
     IAR Container Image Build Utility V2025.02
     Copyright 2020-2025 IAR Systems AB.
 
 Usage:
 build -m /path/to/bx<package>.deb [options]
 build -u https://url.to.iar.com/.../bx<package>.deb [options]
 
 Parameter:                   Description:
 -m, --main-package <file>    The main package.
                              (ex: /path/to/bxarm-9.60.3.deb)
 -u, --url <URL>              Download package.
                              (ex: https://url.to/.../bxarm-9.60.3.deb)
 -h, --help                   Show help information.
 -v, --version                Show utility version.
 
 Option:                      Description:
 -p, --device-package <file>  The C-SPY device support package.
                              (ex: /path/to/bxarm-cspy-device-support-9.60.3.deb)
 -b, --base [18|20|22|24]     Choose Ubuntu Linux base image LTS version.
                              (Default: 20)
 -t, --tag <name:version>     Create an image with customized tag.
                              (Default: iarsystems/bx<package>:<version>)
 -z, --no-cache               Build a container image from scratch.
 
 Experimental:                Description:
 -c, --with-cmake             Include `cmake` in the container image.
 -g, --with-git               Include `git` in the container image.
 -r, --with-sudo              Include `sudo` in the container image.
 -q, --no-cmsis               Exclude `arm/CMSIS` from the container image (up to -129M).
 -n, --no-docs                Exclude `<target>/doc` from the container image (up to -64M).
 -s, --no-source              Exclude `<target>/src` from the container image (up to -318M).
 -o, --no-translation         Exclude localization files from the container image (up to -20M).
```

The `build` script requires at least one of the following parameters:
- the `--main-package /path/to/bx<package>.deb` pointing to a local copy of the `*.deb` installer which was already downloaded -or-
- the `--url https://url.to/.../bx<package>.deb` pointing to the download link of the `*.deb` installer.

Depending on your system specifications, chosen options and installer size, it might take a little while to build an image. In the end, the __`build`__ script will automatically tag the image as __iarsystems/bx`<package>`:`<version>`__ unless specified otherwise.

>[!NOTE]
> When building an image, it is safe to ignore eventual `debconf: delaying package configuration, since apt-utils is not installed` warning messages.


## Building a Docker image for Windows
Before you can run a Docker container on Windows, you need a Docker image that contains the required environment. A Dockerfile contains instructions that describe how to build an image.

After Docker Desktop is completely installed, make sure to upgrade it to the latest version using the Docker Desktop Dashboard.
Enable Windows Containers (right click on docker icon in status bar and click on ‘Switch to Windows Container’)


This [__Dockerfile__](Dockerfile_windows) was created as a universal template to build images with the IAR Build Tools on Windows.

The [__`build`__](build.ps1) script will use the [`docker build`][url-docker-docs-build] command with the Dockerfile, together with an installer package (__bx`<package>`-`<version>`.exe__), to create one image.

To build the image, you need to perform these steps:
1. Set `BX_DOWNLOAD_URL` with the download link to the installer package you received from IAR Customer Support during your on-boarding process.
```powershell
$env:BX_DOWNLOAD_URL="<fill-with-the-download-URL>"
for example: https://updates.iar.com/FileStore/STANDARD/001/003/382/bxarm-9.60.3.7274.exe
```
2. Clone the [bx-docker][url-repo] repository to the user's home directory.
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/iarsystems/bx-docker.git C:\Users\<YourUsername>\bx-docker
```
3. Invoke the __`build`__ script pointing to the downloaded installer package and version:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\<YourUsername>\bx-docker
```
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $env:BX_DOWNLOAD_URL -OutFile (Split-Path -Leaf $env:BX_DOWNLOAD_URL)
```
```powershell
.\build.ps1 -package $env:BX_DOWNLOAD_URL
```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setting up the license 
The IAR Build Tools require an available network license to operate.

The [__`setup-license`__](setup-license) script prepares a named [Docker volume][url-docker-docs-volume] for storing persistent license configuration for any containers belonging to the same __DOCKER_HOST__. 

In the bash shell, perform the following step (replace `iarsystems/bx<image>:<tag>` and `<iar-license-server-ip>` by the actual ones):
```console 
$ ~/bx-docker/setup-license iarsystems/bx<image>:<tag> <iar-license-server-ip>
-- setup-license: Creating a Docker volume for storing persistent license information...
-- setup-license: Running a container for setting up the license...
-- setup-license: Setting up the license with IAR Light License Manager...
-- setup-license: Finished.
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Setting up the license for a Docker image in such a way only needs to be performed once per __DOCKER_HOST__. The Docker Engine will never erase this (or any other) named volume, even after the containers which made use of it are stopped or removed. For manually removing a named volume, remove all containers using it and then use `docker volume rm <volume-name>`.

## Setting up the license for Windows
The IAR Build Tools require an available network license to operate.

The [__`setup-license`__](setup-license.ps1) script prepares a named [Docker volume][url-docker-docs-volume] for storing persistent license configuration for any containers belonging to the same __DOCKER_HOST__.

In the PowerShell, perform the following step (replace `iarsystems/bx<image>:<tag>` and `<iar-license-server-ip>` by the actual ones):
```powershell
.\setup-license.ps1 -PkgNameVersion iarsystems/bx<image>:<tag> -lms2ip <iar-license-server-ip>
```

> [!NOTE]
> During this license setup, we will create a container using the recently built IAR image and stop the container.
> We can start the same container to run the IAR build as described in the section below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example: interactively building a project
Though this is not the way a container image is intended to be used, let's build a project locally and interactively with the container image you have just created.

The following command line will bind the home directory (`$HOME`) to the "my-iar-bx-container" container's working directory (`/workdir`) for the `iarsystems/bx<image>:<tag>` image.

```bash
docker run \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  --detach \
  --tty \
  --name my-iar-bx-container \
  --hostname `hostname` \
  --volume LMS2:/usr/local/etc/IARSystems \
  --volume $HOME:/workdir \
  iarsystems/bx<image>:<tag>
```

Enter the container:
```console
$ docker exec -it my-iar-bx-container bash
root@<hostname>:~# 
```

For this example we will clone a public repository with projects created in the [IAR Embedded Workbench IDE][url-iar-ew] for the supported target architectures:
```console
# git clone https://github.com/iarsystems/bx-workspaces-ci
Cloning into 'bx-workspaces-ci'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 345, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (99/99), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (54/54), done.
remote: Total 345 (delta 44), reused 64 (delta 44), pack-reused 246 (from 1)
Receiving objects: 100% (345/345), 159.12 KiB | 631.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (211/211), done.
```

Finally build the library project for the selected `<target>` (e.g. arm, avr, riscv, rl78, rx, rh850). In the following example, "arm" was selected and `iarbuild` was used to build the project:
```console
# /opt/iarsystems/bxarm/common/bin/iarbuild bx-workspaces-ci/targets/arm/library.ewp -build Release

     IAR Command Line Build Utility V9.3.6.958
     Copyright 2002-2024 IAR Systems AB.


library - Release
Reading project nodes...

Cleaning... 0 files.
crc16.c
crc32.c
library.a

Total number of errors: 0
Total number of warnings: 0
Build succeeded
```

Now build the application project that is linked against the library for the same selected target. In this example, `targets/arm` was selected for demonstration:
```console
# /opt/iarsystems/bxarm/common/bin/iarbuild bx-workspaces-ci/targets/arm/test-crc32.ewp -build Release

     IAR Command Line Build Utility V9.3.6.958
     Copyright 2002-2024 IAR Systems AB.


test-crc32 - Release
Reading project nodes...

Cleaning... 0 files.
test-crc32.c
test-crc32.out

Total number of errors: 0
Total number of warnings: 0
Build succeeded
```

## Running a container on Windows (if not run during License setup)
In this section, you will run an interactive container locally, clone and build a project with the image you have created.

The following command line will bind the home directory (`$HOME`) to the "win-iar-bx-container" container's working directory (`C:\build`) for the `iarsystems/bx<image>:<tag>` image.

```powershell
docker run `
  --restart=unless-stopped `
  --detach `
  --tty `
  --name win-iar-bx-container `
  --hostname $env:COMPUTERNAME `
  --volume $env:USERPROFILE:C:\build `
  iarsystems/bx<image>:<tag>
```

You can check your containers with `docker container ls`:
```powershell
docker container ls
```

Enter the container:
```powershell
docker exec -it win-iar-bx-container powershell
```

## Building projects with the IAR Build Tools on Windows
Finally, build the library project for the selected `<target>` (e.g. arm, avr, riscv, rl78, rx, rh850). In the following example, "arm" was selected and `iarbuild` was used to build the project:

For this example we will clone a public repository with projects created in the [IAR Embedded Workbench IDE][url-iar-ew] for the supported target architectures:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/iarsystems/bx-workspaces-ci
```

```powershell
iarbuild bx-workspaces-ci\targets\arm\library.ewp -build Release
```

> [!TIP]
> Invoke `iarbuild` with no parameters for a detailed description of available options.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Performing static code analysis
Additionally, [IAR C-STAT][url-iar-cstat] is an add-on to the IAR Build Tools that can perform static code analysis. It helps you ensure code quality in your applications. If you have C-STAT, `iarbuild` can drive the analysis with the `-cstat_analyze <build-cfg>` command to analyze the project.

Using the library project in `bx-workspaces-ci/targets/arm` as an example:
```console
# /opt/iarsystems/bxarm/common/bin/iarbuild bx-workspaces-ci/targets/arm/library.ewp -cstat_analyze Release

     IAR Command Line Build Utility V9.3.6.958
     Copyright 2002-2024 IAR Systems AB.


library - Release

Analysis completed. 8 message(s)
```

The analysis results are stored in an SQLite database named `cstat.db`. Use `icstat` to retrieve the warnings and display them on the terminal. For example:
```console
# /opt/iarsystems/bxarm/arm/bin/icstat load --db $(find bx-workspaces-ci -name "cstat.db")
"bx-workspaces-ci/library/source/crc32.c",29 Severity-Medium[ATH-shift-neg]:LHS argument of right shift operator may be negative. Its range is [-INF,INF].
"bx-workspaces-ci/library/source/crc32.c",30 Severity-Medium[ATH-shift-neg]:LHS argument of right shift operator may be negative. Its range is [-INF,INF].
"bx-workspaces-ci/library/source/crc32.c",31 Severity-Medium[ATH-shift-neg]:LHS argument of right shift operator may be negative. Its range is [-INF,INF].
"bx-workspaces-ci/library/source/crc32.c",32 Severity-Medium[ATH-shift-neg]:LHS argument of right shift operator may be negative. Its range is [-INF,INF].
"bx-workspaces-ci/library/source/crc32.c",33 Severity-Medium[ATH-shift-neg]:LHS argument of right shift operator may be negative. Its range is [-INF,INF].
"bx-workspaces-ci/library/source/crc32.c",34 Severity-Medium[ATH-shift-neg]:LHS argument of right shift operator may be negative. Its range is [-INF,INF].
"bx-workspaces-ci/library/source/crc32.c",35 Severity-Medium[ATH-shift-neg]:LHS argument of right shift operator may be negative. Its range is [-INF,INF].
"bx-workspaces-ci/library/source/crc32.c",36 Severity-Medium[ATH-shift-neg]:LHS argument of right shift operator may be negative. Its range is [-INF,INF].
```

The same database can be used for generating an analysis report with warnings about coding violations for the project's ruleset selection. Use `ireport` to generate an HTML report. In this example:
```console
# /opt/iarsystems/bxarm/arm/bin/ireport --full --project library --db $(find bx-workspaces-ci -name "cstat.db")
HTML report generated: library.html
```

Now exit the container:
```console
# exit
```

Thanks to running the container with the `--volume $HOME:/workdir` parameter, all existing files from the home directory and below are bound to the container's `/workdir` working directory. In this case, once you exit the container, any files within the `/workdir` directory will remain in their correspondent locations under the home directory.

You will find all your project files generated in this example under `~/bx-workspaces-ci`. However they belong to root as it was the default user for the container. In order to get ownership of all generated files, perform:
```console
$ sudo chown -Rv $USER:$USER bx-workspaces-ci/
changed ownership of 'bx-workspaces-ci/LICENSE' from root:root to <user>:<user>
changed ownership of 'bx-workspaces-ci/tests/test-crc32.c' from root:root to <user>:<user>
changed ownership of 'bx-workspaces-ci/tests/test-crc16.c' from root:root to <user>:<user>
[...]
```

>[!TIP]
>Since the container was run with the `--restart=unless-stopped` option, it will remain available for reattaching to it when desired, by using `docker exec -it my-iar-bx-container bash`, until it is manually stopped with `docker stop my-iar-bx-container`. The `docker run --help` command provides more information on different ways of running docker containers.
